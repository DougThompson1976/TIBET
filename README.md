# Installation

If you don't have `Node.js` and `npm` installed start with the <a
href="#prereqs">Prerequisites</a>.

If you prefer to install via `git` see the <a href="#gitinstall">TIBET Git
Installation</a> instructions.


#### Installing TIBET via `npm`

TIBET should be installed globally using `npm install -g`:<br/>

```bash
npm install -g tibet
```

Initial installation process can take several minutes depending on the speed of
your network connection and the particular version being installed. Be patient
:).

Once your installation completes we recommend the <a href="https://github.com/TechnicalPursuit/TIBET/wiki/TIBET-Quickstart-Guide" target="_blank">TIBET Quickstart Guide</a>.

#### Command Line

Use `tibet help` for more information on the TIBET CLI and the available command
set for your version, or check out the full <a
href="https://github.com/TechnicalPursuit/TIBET/wiki/TIBET-Command-Line"
target="_blank">TIBET CLI</a> documentation on the wiki.

#### API Docs

##### `tibet reflect`

API documentation is generated for your TIBET version via `tibet reflect` at
the command line and via `:reflect` from within the <a
href="https://github.com/TechnicalPursuit/TIBET/wiki/TIBET-Shell"
target="_blank">TIBET Shell</a>. TIBET's `reflect` options can output type
lists, method lists, or individual object documentation.

##### `tibet apropos`

To explore TIBET functionality use the `tibet apropos` command
or `:apropos` from the <a
href="https://github.com/TechnicalPursuit/TIBET/wiki/TIBET-Shell"
target="_blank">TIBET Shell</a>. The `apropos` feature scans method names and
comments for matching terms, letting you search TIBET for functionality that
relates to a topic.

#### Your Docs

**`tibet reflect` and `tibet apropos` work on your code as well.**

TIBET's tools use runtime metadata and their knowledge of your code to produce
documentation for both the library and your application code. All you need to do
is use jsdoc3 comment syntax and <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/TechnicalPursuit/TIBET/wiki/TIBET-Coding-Standards#commentinside">place
your comments inside the method body</a>.

See TIBET source code for examples on how to author for live runtime docs.

# Prerequisites

#### Install Node.js

TIBET relies on Node.js and npm for command line tooling and integration of
today's best JavaScript modules. To install TIBET make sure
you have a recent version of Node.js.

**We strongly recommend you use the Node Version Manager (`nvm`)** to manage
your Node.js installation. Using `nvm` lets you install multiple versions of
Node.js and switch between them with ease which is great for development.

To install Node.js via `nvm` see the instructions at <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm">the nvm GitHub repo</a>.

To install Node.js without `nvm` follow the instructions at <a href="http://nodejs.org"
   target="_blank">nodejs.org</a>.

#### Update npm (optional)

If you already have a recent version of Node.js installed you should have a
valid version of `npm`. Unfortunately some older versions of `npm` suffer from
race condition errors. On \*nix variants update `npm` by running:<br/>

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```

If you see errors from any npm-based operations mentioning `cb() never called!`
you'll want to perform the step above, or the appropriate step for your
operating system. See <a target="_blank"
href="https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm">this npm troubleshooting topic</a> for more.

# Installing TIBET via Git

If you prefer working from a git repository you can install TIBET via git. This
approach can take a fair amount of time depending on connection and machine
speed since you'll need to download all of TIBET's dependencies and build them
locally.

##### First, uninstall any npm-installed version of TIBET

If you have already installed TIBET via npm you need to first remove that
installation to avoid conflicts with your Git-based installation:

```bash
npm uninstall -g tibet
```

##### Create a Fork

If you are going to install TIBET via Git we recommend that you first create a
fork of TIBET so you can manage updates in a stable, predictable fashion.

Follow these instructions to <a target="_blank" href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/">create
your own fork</a>.

##### Clone your Fork

```bash
git clone {{your_fork_repo_url}}
```

##### Initialize your Fork

Once your fork has been cloned move into the new fork directory and install the
package dependencies:

```bash
cd {{your_fork_repo_directory}}
npm install .
```

##### Link TIBET via npm

With your fork initialized you'll need to link the repository via `npm link` so
that the `tibet` command will function. From the top of your TIBET fork type:

```bash
npm link .
```
<br/>
You should now be able to use the `tibet` command which lets you run `tibet
build`.

##### Build TIBET Dependencies and Packages

When working with a `git`-based repository you'll need to rebuild TIBET packages
and dependencies, depending on your individual project launch configuration.

To build the full set of TIBET dependencies and launch packages use:

```
tibet build_all
```

NOTE: the above command can take _quite some time_ depending on your network
connection, machine performance, etc. since it's building a large set of
dependent modules in addition to TIBET itself.

With TIBET cloned, initialized, linked, and built you're ready to rock.
