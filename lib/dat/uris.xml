  <!--
  The uri element is from XML Catalog, but we extend it quite a bit to
  support the various use cases we have for URI rewriting and routing.

  In XML Catalog you have name and uri attributes which define the 'key'
  and 'value' of a particular mapping and the first matching entry wins.
  These entries are checked explicitly by TIBET rewrite operations along
  with rewriteURI node entries which are pattern based.

  To support alternative rewrite mappings based on the user and their
  potential role/unit assignments we add the tibet:unit, tibet:role, and
  tibet:user attributes. Mappings which leverage these can be used to
  provide role-specific UI templates, CSS, or other components, perhaps
  filtering URI resolution for managers vs. regular staff.

  To support filtering on application configuration and current state we
  use tibet:env, tibet:state, and tibet:offline attributes which support
  filters for common application state infrastructure. These types of
  filters can be used to manage different content during development vs.
  test vs. production, or to provide alternative URI mappings when the
  user is offline, or to shift templates based on current state.

  To support localized mappings we also add support for filtering based
  on xml:lang values which are acquired from the TP.core.Locale type. As a
  variant of "localization" we also support a tibet:browser attribute that
  allows a URI to be remapped for a particular browser. This is sometimes
  useful for files such as XSLTs which may require slightly different
  content across browsers. The tibet:browserUI attribute is useful for
  testing the specific rendering engine rather than the overall browser.

  To support local disk caches we add tibet:localuri, tibet:updated, and
  tibet:duration attributes to define the local disk URI, last updated
  date/time, and duration defining how long before a refresh. NOTE that
  the last update times require that this file be updated whenever the
  file is actually refreshed, which can add overhead if the local cache
  files aren't being used for a particular file. As a result these values
  are only saved if the local cache file is actually updated.

  To support type-based URI handling we add a tibet:urihandler attribute
  which should name a TIBET type responsible for operations related to
  this URI.

  A tibet:contenttype attribute can be used to provide type mappings to
  manage the actual content to be found at the end of a URI. It should
  name a TIBET type responsible for operations related to this URI.
  This is particularly useful for URIs which access raw JSON where you'd
  like to force a specific object type to be used as the content wrapper.

  <!--
  The XML Catalog specification defines a rewriteURI element which allows
  the uriStartString to be rewritten with a new rewritePrefix. These rules
  are applied when a specific match isn't found above, and since they're
  replacements they essentially all have to be run, so you want to limit
  their number if possible.

  <!--
  The XML Catalog delegateURI entry tells the system that resolution of
  URIs prefixed with the uriStartString should be looked up in the XML
  Catalog file provided. This delegation check is done after direct lookup
  and rewriting have been performed without success.

  TIBET extends this element in multiple ways:

    1.  by allowing a powerful tibet:uriMatchString attribute that
        contains a regular expression.

    2.  by allowing a tibet:urihandler attribute to delegate
        responsibility for handling URIs to some TIBET type.

    3.  by allowing a tibet:contenttype attribute to delegate
        responsibility for handling the content at the end of the URI to
        some TIBET type.

  The XML Catalog nextCatalog element lets you create composite catalogs
  by listing additional catalog files to check. This lets you modularize
  URI mappings more effectively. These entries are only checked when all
  else fails, regardless of where they may be found in the file. Putting
  them at the end in the order you'd like them searched seems like the
  best practice though.
