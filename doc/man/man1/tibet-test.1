.SH "NAME"
\fBtibet-test\fR \- runs unit/functional tests on your application
.SH SYNOPSIS
.P
tibet test [<target>] [\-\-suite <filter>] [\-\-cases <filter>] [\-\-context <app|lib|all>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.P
Runs unit, functional, and/or integration tests on your application\.
.P
CLI\-initiated tests check to see if the \fBkarma\-tibet\fP testing module and \fBkarma\fP
.br
have been installed in your project\. If so the command delegates to \fBkarma
start\fP to run your tests\. If \fBkarma\fP isn't installed \fBphantomjs\fP is checked and
.br
tests will run in the context of \fBphantomjs\fP if found\.
.P
If you are not using \fBkarma\fP you can specify a particular test target object or
.br
test suite to run as the first argument to the command\. If you need to specify
.br
both a target and suite use \fB\-\-target\fP and \fB\-\-suite\fP respectively\.
.P
Again, outside of \fBkarma\fP you can limit testing to a particular case or set of
.br
cases by using the \fB\-\-cases\fP parameter\. Both \fB\-\-suite\fP and \fB\-\-cases\fP accept
.br
either a string or a regular expression in JavaScript syntax such as \fB\-\-cases
/foo/i\fP\|\. Filtering options from the \fB:test\fP TSH command are not currently
.br
available when running via karma\.
.P
For phantomjs testing output is to the terminal in colorized TAP format by default\.
.br
Future versions will support additional test output formatters\.
.P
You can use the built\-in debugging facilities of PhantomJS by
.br
specifying \fB\-\-remote\-debug\-port\fP and a port number\.
.SH OPTIONS
.RS 0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBtarget\fP :
.br
An optional target, usually a type name, to run tests on\. Unlike other test
.br
frameworks TIBET's tests are typically associated with an object such as a type\.
.br
This lets you quickly test a type by simply specifying it as a \fBtarget\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-cases\fP :
.br
A specific case name or a /pattern/ to match to filter case names\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-context\fP :
.br
Sets the context of the scan which is run\. The default is \fBapp\fP
.br
which scans only application\-level resources, ignoring any potential library
.br
resources\. Other values are \fBlib\fP and \fBall\fP\|\.
.IP \(bu 2
\fB\-\-suite\fP :
.br
A specific suite name or a /pattern/ to match to filter suite names\.
