	<h2>XInclude Test #1</h2><br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	This test ensures that the XInclude processing is working properly.<br/>

	It tests 'simple' XInclude tags, that is XIncludes that will include the entire content of their href URI when encountered:<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	&lt;xi:include href="XIncludePart1.xml"&lt;/xi:include&gt;<br/>
	<br/>
    <br/>

	This is an inclusion of the 'Part 1' file:
	<br/>
    <br/>

	<xi:include href="XIncludePart1.xml">
		<xi:fallback>
		Couldn't get Part #1. Shouldn't get here.
		</xi:fallback>
    </xi:include>

	<br/>
    <br/>

	This is an inclusion of the 'Part 10' file (which won't exist so we'll get fallback behavior):
    <br/>
    <br/>

	<xi:include href="XIncludePart10.xml">
		<xi:fallback>
            <span id="part10Fallback">Couldn't get Part #1. Shouldn't get here.</span>
		</xi:fallback>
    </xi:include>
