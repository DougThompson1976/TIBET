	<h2>XInclude Test #2</h2><br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	This test ensures that the XInclude processing is working properly.<br/>

	It tests 'partial' XInclude tags, that is XIncludes that will include only a portion of the content of their href URI when encountered. XPointer syntax is used to extract a portion of the content:<br/>
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Here is an example of using 'id's (i.e. XPointer 'bare name' syntax):<br/>

	&lt;xi:include href="XIncludePart2.xml" xpointer="partialDiv"&gt;&lt;/xi:include&gt;
	<br/>
	<br/>

	<xi:include href="XIncludePart2.xml" xpointer="partialDiv">
		<xi:fallback>
		Couldn't get Part #2. Shouldn't get here.
		</xi:fallback>
    </xi:include>

	<br/>
	<br/>
	Here is an example of using XPath syntax (i.e. utilizing the xpointer() function):<br/>

	&lt;xi:include href="XIncludePart2.xml" xpointer="xpointer(//*[name() = 'p'])"&gt;&lt;/xi:include&gt;

	<br/>
    <br/>

	<xi:include href="XIncludePart2.xml" xpointer="xpointer(//*[name() = 'p'])">
		<xi:fallback>
		Couldn't get Part #2. Shouldn't get here.
		</xi:fallback>
	</xi:include>
